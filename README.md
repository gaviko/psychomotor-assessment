# psychomotor-assessment

This is could hopefully become an open-source tool used in developing countries to assess whether an individual can receive training in high risk activities such as heavy equipment operation and working at heights. It should consist of several tests, each assessing different aspects of cognition. It should provide training facilitators with data that could potentially used to improve training events. 

I would like to work with a team of developers to ensure that it is a quality product as well as learn the fundamentals of software development.
